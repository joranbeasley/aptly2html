aptly2html aims to provide a simple interface to quickly provide a snapshot singlepage html application that 
describes the packages available on a given aptly server.  this, of coarse, means you are [using aptly](https://www.aptly.info/) 
to serve your debian packages.

there are two tools included in the package

`aptly2json` which will export the aptly repo to a json string suitable for serving with an api

`aptly2html` which will export the repo to a singlefile html that can be dropped anywhere
